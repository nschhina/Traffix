## Tasks
### Stage 1: Framework
*Target Date: Sunday, October 22nd*
- [x] create structures for roads, intersections, traffic lights **(Wesley)**
- [x] create structures for Graph **(Wesley)**
- [x] implement algorithms Dijkstra's Shortest Path **(Wesley)**
- [x] develop first iteration of optimization algorithm to determine traffic light timing, taking into account the flow of traffic, 3-way intersections, left turn signals **(Navraj)**
- [x] mapped out grid layout for prototype **(Brooke)**

### Stage 2: Basic Prototype
*Target Date: Thursday, October 26th*
- [x] create structure for cars **(Wesley)**
- [x] random car spawner and random destinations **(Wesley)**
- [x] implement pre-timed traffic light system **(Wesley)**
- [x] implement grid layout of city **(Brooke)**
- [x] display traffic map of city in console, may skip and implement graphical display (Stage 3/4) instead **(Wesley and Navraj)**
- [x] working simulation

### Stage 3: Prototype Improvements
*Target Date: Sunday, October 29th*
- [ ] efficiency calculator **(Navraj)**
- [ ] take one-way roads into account **(Navraj)**
- [ ] develop model for speed of cars based on congestion **(Navraj)**
- [ ] small random factor of speed of cars **(Wesley)**
- [ ] implement first iteration of optimization algorithm **(Wesley)**
- [ ] basic display of flow of vehicles on roads **(Brooke)**

### Stage 4: Graphical Display and Traffic Light Synchronization
*Target Date: Thursday, November 2nd*
- [ ] program should be able to run from a Raspberry Pi connected to an LCD screen **(Wesley and Navraj)**
- [ ] display traffic map of city on an LCD screen **(Navraj and Brooke)**
- [ ] display additional information such as the volume of vehicles, average travel time, congestion level of a specific roads **(Brooke)**
- [ ] improve optimization algorithm to synchronize traffic lights **(Wesley and Navraj)**
- [ ] non grid layouts supported **(Wesley)**
- [ ] replace assert statements with error and warning log **(Wesley)**

### Stage 5: User Interaction
*Target Date: Thursday, November 9th*
- [ ] allow user to control speed of simulation **(Wesley)**
- [ ] allow user to add cars, select destination, change road layout **(Wesley)**
- [ ] allow user to make slight modifications to the algorithm (such as how quickly it responds to changes in the environment) **(Wesley)**
- [ ] improve graphical interface, and add methods to modify environment variables **(Brooke)**

### Stage 6: Secondary Display/Physical Model (Tentative)
*Target Date: Thursday, November 16th*
- [ ] connect secondary display **(Navraj)**
- [ ] implement secondary display or physical model of city **(Brooke)**
- [ ] allow close up of a portion of the map **(Wesley)**
- [ ] allow user to follow a vehicle **(Wesley and Brooke)**

### Stage 7: Final Demo, Optimizing Performance
*Target Date: Thursday, November 23rd*
- [ ] polish user interface **(Brooke)**
- [ ] improve primary and secondary displays **(Brooke and Navraj)**
- [ ] increased random factor of cars **(Wesley and Navraj)**
- [ ] optimize performance of simulation **(Wesley)**

### Stretch Tasks
*Only if there is time*
- [ ] pedestrian traffic
- [ ] non-controlled intersections (no traffic lights)
- [ ] accidents, road closures, weather
- [ ] drivers not following rules
- [ ] add option to model traffic based on time of day
