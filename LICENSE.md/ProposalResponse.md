# Group 22 - Traffix

## Tentative Rating
Above Average. Sounds a bit too ambitious, but you can stage this project at least.

## Comments
 - Consider the scope of this project: when is a city "too big"?
 - Using LEDs to represent cars sounds either infeasible or uninteresting (do I get any extra information from looking at the LEDs?). Maybe both.
 - Keep the configuration simple first...then create the UI. First figure out if you can even simulate the physical model.
 - Modelling traffic usually involves also modelling source/sinks. What will your sources and sinks be?
